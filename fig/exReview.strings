{\it I saw this series mentioned in the magazine Entertainment 
			Weekly and looked for it online. I was pleasantly surprised 
			to see the episodes posted on YouTube. I just finished watching 
			this particular episode and have to say for a ``fan effort 
			I thought it was far superior to any of the spin offs.
			I think Gene Roddenberry would be very pleased with what's up 
			there on that screen. What kept going through my mind is that I 
			was watching something that should have occurred thirty years ago. 
			I always felt that the spin offs had been taken over by people 
			who really were not fans of the original and that Gene 
			Roddenberry's original vision had been butchered horribly. 
			``Star Trek: New Voyages is what should have happened 
			all those years ago!} \newline
